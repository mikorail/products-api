# Thought Process, Constraints, and Ambiguities

This document outlines the decisions, considerations, and challenges faced during the development of the Products API, which includes CRUD operations for customers, products, categories, and orders. The system leverages PostgreSQL, Redis, and the Gin web framework in Go.

## 1. **CRUD for Customers, Products, Categories, and Orders**

### Thought Process:
The primary motivation behind implementing CRUD operations for customers, products, categories, and orders was to create a standardized way to manage each entity in the system. This foundation facilitates essential tasks like inserting, updating, retrieving, and deleting records in the database.

To support bulk data generation and testing, these CRUD endpoints also work seamlessly with external scripts. The use of libraries like **Faker** makes it easier to create mock data quickly for testing various scenarios. This accelerates development and testing cycles by allowing bulk insertion of realistic, yet randomly generated, data.

### Constraints:
- **Atomicity of Operations**: Each CRUD operation had to be atomic, ensuring consistency and reliability. Transactions were considered to ensure that operations either succeed completely or fail gracefully.
  
- **Performance in Bulk Operations**: Given the potential volume of data, optimizing bulk insertions and retrievals was crucial. PostgreSQL was chosen for its reliability and scaling capabilities, but optimizations (such as batch insertions) were kept in mind.

### Ambiguities:
- **How much validation is needed?** There was some ambiguity in determining the balance between strict validation (which ensures data integrity) and lenient validation (which allows flexibility). For instance, while creating orders, should the system validate customer existence in real-time, or should it defer such validation?

## 2. **Optimization through Partitioning and Caching**

### Thought Process:
Optimizing the system for high performance, especially when dealing with large datasets, required a combination of **partitioning** and **caching** strategies.

- **Partitioning**: 
  Partitioning was considered essential for database performance. Date-based partitioning, in particular, was chosen due to its inherent advantages in handling time-series data (like orders). This allows efficient querying and archiving based on the creation date of records, reducing the query load on the main database tables.

  Date-based partitioning can be highly beneficial when dealing with datasets that grow over time, ensuring that queries related to older or less frequently accessed data don’t slow down the entire system.

- **Caching**: 
  Caching was focused on the **GET** operations, as these are most frequently used, and data retrieval performance is a key factor for user experience. **Redis** was chosen for caching due to its speed and ease of integration. Caching frequently accessed data reduces the load on the database, speeding up response times.

  A **cache invalidation strategy** was necessary to ensure that stale data is refreshed appropriately. The thought process behind this was to keep the cache for 10 minutes, ensuring that if there is any inconsistency between cached data and the database, it would be synced within this time window. This allows for a balance between performance and data accuracy.

### Constraints:
- **Database Partitioning**: Partitioning can introduce complexity, especially around managing and querying data across different partitions. Implementing partitioning efficiently without overcomplicating queries was a challenge. The constraint was to ensure that queries targeting specific partitions are optimized.

- **Cache Consistency**: Maintaining consistency between the cache and the database is always a challenge. A too-aggressive caching policy might lead to stale data, while too-frequent cache invalidations can undermine the benefits of caching. The 10-minute sync period was chosen to balance these needs.

### Ambiguities:
- **How granular should partitioning be?** Date-based partitioning makes sense for orders due to their chronological nature, but for products or categories, should there be partitioning based on another criterion (e.g., popularity, category)? This was left ambiguous, but could be an area for further optimization depending on system growth.

- **Cache Invalidation**: How to handle scenarios where immediate data consistency is critical (e.g., real-time updates)? While the 10-minute sync period works for most cases, situations where near-instant consistency is required would need a different approach. This was acknowledged as an ambiguity but considered acceptable within the current use cases.

## Conclusion

This project leverages foundational design principles such as CRUD for manageability and flexibility, partitioning for performance scaling, and caching for speed optimization. There are ongoing opportunities to refine these techniques, particularly with advanced partitioning schemes or finer cache invalidation controls. Future optimizations may address the ambiguities in data validation and partitioning strategies as the system grows in complexity.

This document helps provide clarity on the design decisions made during the project, highlighting both the thought process and areas where further decisions could be refined as the system evolves.
